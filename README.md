# Webpage

Basic Webpage: Static Homepage

Dynamics:
an extension of Student Survey Form of the Basic Webpages and enhanced using JavaScript functionality. 
Demonstrated how to use cookie, JavaScript functions, event handling, jQuery, and Ajax implementation.

Processing:
Server-side processing of the Student Survey Form data via MVC implementation using a RequestDispatcher object.
Implemented one Servlet that acts as a front controller that receives all client requests, saves the form data to a database table, performs business logic(s) via business delegate classes, stores JavaBean objects into a session or request object, and then forwards the request to appropriate JSP to present the data to the user.
All business logic code is put into separate Java class(es) which could be called from within the servlet to perform specific tasks.
All presentation logic is moved to JSP pages.

Reimplemented Processing:
Re-implement processing using Angular and RESTful Web Services.
